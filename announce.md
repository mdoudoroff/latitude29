We’re open for business!  Please note that our hours may be subject to change during the month of September; for instance our Friday and Saturday hours are 3PM-1AM until the end of the month.

The Bienville House Hotel is closed for renovations, so our only entrance is 321 N. Peter’s Street. 

Minors are only permitted to sit in the restaurant, not the bar or lounge. If your party includes anyone under the age of 21, please call and speak with a manager about our policies.  No children under the age of 7 are permitted in any part of the restaurant.

For special bookings and buy-outs, please contact brad@latitude29nola.com
  
Mahalo!
